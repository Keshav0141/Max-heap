# Max Heap Implementation in C++

## 📜 Overview
This project implements a **Max Heap** data structure in C++.  
A Max Heap is a complete binary tree where the value of each parent node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.  
The implementation supports heap creation, deletion (extracting the maximum element), and printing the heap structure after each operation.

The program is interactive — it allows users to perform heap operations through a simple command-line menu.

## ⚙️ Features
- Build a **max heap** from a user-provided array.
- **Extract** (delete) the maximum element repeatedly.
- Display the **current heap** after every extraction.
- View the **sorted sequence** of extracted elements.
- Display the **entire array**, including deleted elements (for clarity).
